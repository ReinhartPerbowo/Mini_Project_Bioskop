# Mini_Project_Bioskop

This is the project I made in my free time during the holidays when i took the Java Fundemental course from Kodehive Academy. This Bioskop project is actually a simple menu that consist an option to add movies and their informations, look at the list of movies created, look at movies based on their show date (from the earliest to the latest), and look at movies based on the cheapest price. The programming languages I used to make this mini project are JAVA and SQL. This project connects the JAVA with SQL so that when we add and/or look at the list of movies, it will take the data from the SQL database I already make and connected in.
